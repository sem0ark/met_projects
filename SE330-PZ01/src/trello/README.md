Reimplemented and refactored version of react-trello:

- Moved to from Redux to Zustand+Immer.
- Updated functionality to work with React 19.
- Updated logic to work using Tailwind classes, compatible with DaisyUI.

Note: I am just a plain Middle BE/FE developer and this is a one time use university project, it is unlikely to be used for anything else.
