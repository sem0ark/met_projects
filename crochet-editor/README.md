**This is a fork** of [CrochetPARADE](https://codeberg.org/crochetparade/CrochetPARADE) that is attempting to improve UX and functionality of CrochetPARADE application, initial files are located at `/old` folder.
Main idea - use a reworked version of d3-force force-based engine and bindings to react from force-graph, to create a usable editor without requiring learning a custom syntax.

**Original repo is located on codeberg.org:** [https://codeberg.org/crochetparade/CrochetPARADE](https://codeberg.org/crochetparade/CrochetPARADE)
